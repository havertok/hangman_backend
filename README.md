# hangman_backend
Backend for hangman project

This is a personal project.

Backend for a hangman game, stores Puzzles with Hidden Words and a list of letters guessed on that word.  7 shots and you win the puzzle.

Can send all puzzles, and modify existing ones. (Adding new puzzles reservered for registered users, both user login/registration and puzzle posting are WIP)

Users can register directly (not secure WIP) via a static Thymeleaf form.  Mostly to see how to do that sort of thing, also helpful for testing.

Working on adding security to store passwords securly.
